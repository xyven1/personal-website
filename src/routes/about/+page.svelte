		I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at WPI, with plans to complete
		a 4 year BS/MS program with a focus on ML. I start coding nearly 10 years ago, starting with
		software for Arduino and have been coding avidly since. Most of my programming knowledge is
		self-taught through personal projects and lectures on YouTube. I have devloped a strong ability
		to learn new languages, techniques, and skills quickly and without help from others.
