<h1 class="text-2xl m-auto text-center">
	I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at WPI, with plans to complete a
	4 year BS/MS program with a focus on ML. I start coding nearly 10 years ago, starting with
	software for Arduino and have been coding avidly since. Most of my programming knowledge is
	self-taught through personal projects and lectures on YouTube. I have devloped a strong ability to
  learn new languages, techniques, and skills quickly and without help from others.
